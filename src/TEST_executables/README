This is a directory to contain improved executable code on a new branch.

The source code found in the "executables" directory on the main branch is
generally poorly written (see the README in that directory).  It's been
a stretch goal of mine to write something better.  Currently, it seems
like it would be a better idea to write new code from the ground up
rather than try to make changes to the existing code (this is why it's
on a branch and not something I've been working on in master).

A lot of what's in the existing executables directory can be used as
a good basis for what I intend to do here.  The files handling
the daemonization process are fine and can be reused, so they are
included as they written. 

Like everything else, this is a work in progress.
