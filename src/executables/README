TODO: Redesign and reimplement the program defined by the files in this directory
and all its subdirectories.

Explanation:

This program is the sloppiest part of the project, but I needed to write something we could
use to get results.  At present, it is just a basic program to log system call information.
It should DEFINITELY be redesigned and cleaned up.

The files in question are everything in this directory and all its subdirectories.
